Click [Here](https://project2-wayfarer.herokuapp.com/) for a demo!

## Brief
We have been commissioned to build a travel community, code-named Project Wayfarer for now, for users to share tips (AKA posts) about their favorite locations around the world.

### Client Contract 
- The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories. In some cases, these requirements may be vague or incomplete. 
Sprint 1: Basic Auth & Profiles
A user should be able to:

Navigate to "/" and see a basic splash page with:
The name of the website.
Links to "Log In" and "Sign Up".
Sign up for an account.
Log in to their account if they already have one.
Be redirected to their public profile page after logging in.
On their public profile page, see their name, the current city they have set in their profile, and their join date.
See the site-wide header on every page with:
A link to "Log Out" if they're logged in.
Links to "Log In" and "Sign Up" if they're logged out.
Update their profile by making changes to their name and/or current city.
See the titles of all the posts they've contributed (start with pre-seeded data).
Click on the title of one of their posts and be redirected to a "show" page for that post.
View post "show" pages with title, author, and content.
